### Overview

Serious injury or illness can lead to a significant loss of working hours and
substantial health care costs, when an employee is no longer able to perform his
work appropriately. Physical workload was found to be an independent risk
factor for disability retirement due to musculoskeletal disorders.
When reintegrating patients into the work process after serious injury or
illness, employers and insurance agencies may have to assess the work capacity
of a person in order to adequately adjust the job profile.

The Physical Workload Calculator uses various personal- and job-related factors 
for evaluating workload, besides VO<sub>2</sub>max:

#### Physical Activity

Physical activity can be assessed with devices that measure movements and heat 
produced by the body. It can be expressed as metabolic equivalents (METs),
describing the oxygen consumption per kilogram per minute during any given
activity.
One MET corresponds to 3.5 ml O<sub>2</sub>/kg/min.

- Moderate physical activity (MPA) : 3-6 metabolic equivalents (METs)
- high physical activity (HPA) : 6-9 METs 
- very high physical activity (VHPA) : ≥9 METs

#### Occupational Activity

- low-intensity: managers, scientists, office workers
- moderate-intensity: technicians, service workers, machine operators
- high-intensity: agricultural workers, craftsmen, labourers

#### Maximal oxygen consumption

Aerobic capacity has been shown to be an adequate indicator for assessing
individuals’ work capacity. It can be easily assessed with the 20-meter shuttle
run test.
